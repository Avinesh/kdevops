config INSTALL_ANSIBLE_KDEVOPS
	bool "Installs the main ansible kdevops role"
	default y
	help
	  kdevops consists of a series of ansible roles, amongst other things.
	  In order to allow users to easily upgrade, instead of updating tons
	  of dependencies, we provide a convenient single ansible role
	  which you can use to update, and we do the work for you on getting
	  the kdevops ansible role dependencies for you. You want to enable
	  this option and only disable this if you are debugging or testing
	  things.

config INSTALL_ANSIBLE_KDEVOPS_ROLES
	bool "Installs the roles on which kdevops depends on"
	default y
	help
	  If this option is enabled then the ansible roles which pertain to
	  kdevops will be installed. You want to enable this. Disabling this
	  is only encouraged if debugging. You want to enable this unless
	  you know what you are doing, and know you really don't want this.

if INSTALL_ANSIBLE_KDEVOPS_ROLES

config FORCE_INSTALL_ANSIBLE_KDEVOPS
	bool "Enable forcing installation"
	default y
	help
	  Saying yes here will ensure we use "--force" when installing
	  the ansible galaxy dependencies. This is a good idea if you want
	  to be certain no one has mucked with the ansible roles locally.

	  Also, unfortunately if you don't say yes here you won't get updates
	  to ansible roles if you already have an older version installed.
	  This seems to be a "feature" of ansible, ie, not a bug.

config VAGRANT
	bool "Vagrant"
	default y
	help
	  This option will enable use of vagrant. Enable this if you want to
	  use local virtualization technologies such as KVM with libvirt or
	  VirtualBox. Enabling this feature will enable you to select which
	  target guests to use, and configures things for you. It will also
	  ensure dependencies are installed for vagrant when running:

	    make deps

source "vagrant/Kconfig"

config TERRAFORM
	bool "Terraform"
	default y
	help
	  This option will enable use of vagrant. Enable this if you want to
	  use terraform to create nodes on a cloud environment such as:

	    * Azure
	    * AWS
	    * OpenStack
	    * GCE

	  Enabling this option will enable installing terraform dependencies
	  when you run:

	    make deps

	  If you are not using a cloud environment just disable this.

config BOOTLINUX
	bool "Options to get or install Linux from git"
	default y
	help
	  This option will allow the 'make linux' target be usable for you
	  to just get Linux from git, or to install it as well.

	  Say y unless you don't want to have 'make linux' do anything.
