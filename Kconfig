config KDEVOPS_FIRST_RUN
	bool "Is this your first time running kdevops on this system?"
	default n
	help
	  When you run kdevops for the first time we can enable options
	  to help you install software you may need, as well as do sanity
	  checks for you. Enabling this option will set to the default to "y"
	  for a series of entries which will help you with this first run.
	  Enabling these are not required, they do however help.

config KDEVOPS_JUST_UPDATED
	bool "You have you just updated kdevops?"
	default y if KDEVOPS_FIRST_RUN
	default n if !KDEVOPS_FIRST_RUN
	help
	  If you have been running kdevops for a while but have just updated
	  kdevops you may need a new set of ansible roles installed. Setting
	  this to true will enable sensible defaults to ensure we check this
	  for you.
