	  The fstests git tree will be cloned, and set up for you, and
	  you will be able to run create a baseline for your target filesystem,
	  and also test to ensure you don't regress that baseline. If a baseline
	  already exists against your distribution you will be able to ensure
	  you don't regress against development changes on your kernel.
