	  If this option is enabled then the ansible role which configures
	  libvirt for you will be run. This typically just requires adding the
	  user to a specific set of groups. The user must log out and back
	  in again, to ensure the new group takes effect. The goal in the
	  configuration will be to ensure you can use libvirt to spawn guests
	  as a regular user. You are encouraged to say y here unless you know
	  what you are doing or you already know this works. If you are unsure,
	  the litmus test for this is if you can run vagrant up, on any public
	  demo box available.

	help
	  To enable a user to be able to spawn libvirt guests as a regular user
	  a user is typically added to a few groups. These groups are not
	  effective immediately, and so before a user can assume that they
	  use vagrant they must verify that the required groups are effective.
	  If you enable this option, we will spawn an ansible role that will
	  verfify and ensure that your user is already part of these groups.
	  You can safely say yes here.

config VAGRANT_INSTALL_PRIVATE_BOXES
	bool "Install private vagrant boxes"
	default y
	help
	  If this option is enabled then the ansible role which installs
	  additional vagrant boxes will be run. This is useful if for example,
	  you have private vagrant boxes available and you want to use them.
	  You can safely disable this option if you are using only public
	  vagrant boxes. Enabling this option is safe as well, given no
	  private boxes would be defined, and so nothing is done.
